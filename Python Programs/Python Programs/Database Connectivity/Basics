What is SQLite?

SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless,
zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It is the one database,
which is zero-configured, that means like other database you do not need to
configure it in your system.

SQLite engine is not a standalone process like other databases you can link it
statically or dynamically as per your requirement with your application. The
SQLite accesses its storage files directly.



Why SQLite?

•	SQLite does not require a separate server process or system to operate
        (serverless).
•	SQLite comes with zero configuration which means no setup or a
        administration needed.
•	A complete SQLite database is stored in a single cross-platform disk
        file.
•	SQLite is very small and light weight, less than 400KiB fully configured
        or less than 250KiB with optional features omitted.
•	SQLite is self-contained which means no external dependencies.
•	SQLite transactions are fully ACID-compliant, allowing safe access from
        multiple processes or threads.
•	SQLite supports most of the query language features found in the SQL92
        (SQL2) standard.
•	SQLite is written in ANSI-C and provides simple and easy to use API.
•	SQLite is available on UNIX (Linux, Mac OS-X, Android, iOS) and Windows
        (Win32, WinCE, WinRT).

History:

1.	2000 -- D. Richard Hipp had designed SQLite for the purpose of no
        administration required for operating a program.
        UNQLite (Document oriented database).
2.	2000 -- In August, SQLite 1.0 releAsed with GNU Database Manager.
3.	2011 -- Hipp announced to add UNQl interface to SQLite DB and to develop
        UNQLite (Document oriented database).
