"""  Differrence b/w List & Dictionary
     ---------------------------------
A dictionary is like a list, but more in general. In a list, index value is an integer, while in a dictionary index
value can be any other data type and are called keys. The key will be used as a string as it is easy to recall. A
dictionary is an extremely useful data storage construct for storing and retrieving all key value pairs,
where each element is accessed (or indexed) by a unique key. However, dictionary keys are not in
sequences and hence maintain no left-to-right order.

Key-value pair: We can refer to a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called keys)
and a set of values. Each key maps a value. The association of a key and a value is called a key-value pair.

Syntax:
my_dict = {'key1': 'value1','key2': 'value2','key3': 'value3'…'keyn': 'valuen'}
