"""A static method of a Python class is a method that does not obey the usual
convention in which self, an instance of the class, is the first argument to
the method. It is just like any other function defined in the class but it is
callable without creating the instance of the class. They belong to the class
but they don't use the object self at all. To declare a static method, declare
the method normally but precede it with the built-in staticmethod decorator
called@staticmethod. Good candidates for static methods are methods that do
not reference the self variable."""
