"""The names always belong to the namespace where they are bound, irrespective
of whether they are bound before or after they are referred. This is the reason
which makes Python a lexically scoped language. The variable scopes are
determined entirely by the locations of the variables in the source code of your
program files, not by function calls. If a binding for a variable appears
anywhere inside a function, the variable name is local to that function."""
