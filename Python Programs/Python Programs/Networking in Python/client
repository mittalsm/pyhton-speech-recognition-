"""
A Simple Server:
To write Internet servers:
step-1: we use the socket function available in socket module to create a socket object.
step-2: A socket object is then used to call other functions to setup a socket server.
step-3: Now call bind(hostname, port function to specify a port for your service on the given host.
step-4: Next, call the accept method of the returned object. This method waits until a client
        connects to the port you specified, and then returns a connection object that represents the
        connection to that client.
