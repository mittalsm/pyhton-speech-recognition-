"""
TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are protocols that provide data encryption and authentication
between applications and servers in scenarios where that data is being sent across an insecure network, such as checking your
email (How does the Secure Socket Layer work?). The terms SSL and TLS are often used interchangeably or in conjunction with
each other (TLS/SSL), but one is in fact the predecessor of the other — SSL 3.0 served as the basis for TLS 1.0 which, as a
result, is sometimes referred to as SSL 3.1.
