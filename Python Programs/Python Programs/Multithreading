"""
To implement a new thread using the threading module, you have to do the following:

step-1: Define a new subclass of the Thread class.

step-2: Override the __init__(self [,args]) method to add additional arguments.

step-3: Then, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread should do when started.

Once you have created the new Thread subclass, you can create an instance of it and then start a new
thread by invoking the start(), which will in turn call run() method.
