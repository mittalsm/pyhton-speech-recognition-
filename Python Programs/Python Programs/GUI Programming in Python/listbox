"""

The Listbox widget is used to display a list of items from which a user can select a number of items

Syntax:
Here is the simple syntax to create this widget:

                          w = Listbox ( master, option, ... )


Methods:
Methods on listbox objects include:

Option	                                            Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
activate( index )	     Selects the line specifies by the given index.
curselection()	             Returns a tuple containing the line numbers of the selected element or elements, counting from 0. If nothing
                             is selected, returns an empty tuple.
delete( first, last=None )   Deletes the lines whose indices are in the range [first, last]. If the second argument is omitted, the single line with index first is deleted.
get( first, last=None )      Returns a tuple containing the text of the lines with indices from first to last, inclusive. If the second argument is omitted, returns the text of the line closest to first.
index( i )	             If possible, positions the visible part of the listbox so that the line containing index i is at the top of the widget.
insert( index, *elements )   Insert one or more new lines into the listbox before the line specified by index. Use END as the first argument if you want to add new lines to the end of the listbox.
nearest( y )	             Return the index of the visible line closest to the y-coordinate y relative to the listbox widget.
see( index )	             Adjust the position of the listbox so that the line referred to by index is visible.
size()	                     Returns the number of lines in the listbox.
xview()	                     To make the listbox horizontally scrollable, set the command option of the associated horizontal scrollbar to this method.
xview_moveto( fraction )     Scroll the listbox so that the leftmost fraction of the width of its longest line is outside the left side of the listbox. Fraction is in the range [0,1].
xview_scroll( number, what ) Scrolls the listbox horizontally. For the what argument, use either UNITS to scroll by characters, or PAGES to scroll by pages, that is, by the width of the listbox. The number argument tells how many to scroll.
yview()	                     To make the listbox vertically scrollable, set the command option of the associated vertical scrollbar to this method.
yview_moveto( fraction )     Scroll the listbox so that the top fraction of the width of its longest line is outside the left side of the listbox. Fraction is in the range [0,1].
yview_scroll( number, what ) Scrolls the listbox vertically. For the what argument, use either UNITS to scroll by lines, or PAGES to scroll by pages, that is, by the height of the listbox. The number argument tells how many to scroll.
