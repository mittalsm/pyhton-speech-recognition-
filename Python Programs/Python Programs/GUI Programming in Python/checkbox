The Checkbutton widget is used to display a number of options to a user as toggle buttons. The user can then select
one or more options by clicking the button corresponding to each option.

You can also display images in place of text.

Syntax:
Here is the simple syntax to create this widget:

                     w = Checkbutton ( master, option, ... )
Parameters:

1. master: This represents the parent window.

2. options: Here is the list of most commonly used options for this widget. These options can be used as key-value pairs separated by commas.

Option                           	Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
activebackground	Background color when the checkbutton is under the cursor.
activeforeground	Foreground color when the checkbutton is under the cursor.
bg	                The normal background color displayed behind the label and indicator.
bitmap                 	To display a monochrome image on a button.
bd	                The size of the border around the indicator. Default is 2 pixels.
command	                A procedure to be called every time the user changes the state of this checkbutton.
cursor	                If you set this option to a cursor name (arrow, dot etc.), the mouse cursor will change to that pattern when it is over
                        the checkbutton.
disabledforeground	The foreground color used to render the text of a disabled checkbutton. The default is a stippled version of the default foreground color.
font            	The font used for the text.
fg              	The color used to render the text.
height	                The number of lines of text on the checkbutton. Default is 1.
highlightcolor	        The color of the focus highlight when the checkbutton has the focus.
image	                To display a graphic image on the button.
justify	                If the text contains multiple lines, this option controls how the text is justified: CENTER, LEFT, or RIGHT.
offvalue        	Normally, a checkbutton's associated control variable will be set to 0 when it is cleared (off). You can supply an alternate value for the
                        off state by setting offvalue to that value.
onvalue	                Normally, a checkbutton's associated control variable will be set to 1 when it is set (on). You can supply an alternate value for the on
                        state by setting onvalue to that value.
padx            	How much space to leave to the left and right of the checkbutton and text. Default is 1 pixel.
pady                   	How much space to leave above and below the checkbutton and text. Default is 1 pixel.
relief           	With the default value, relief=FLAT, the checkbutton does not stand out from its background. You may set this option to any of the other
                        styles
selectcolor	        The color of the checkbutton when it is set. Default is selectcolor="red".
selectimage	        If you set this option to an image, that image will appear in the checkbutton when it is set.
state	                The default is state=NORMAL, but you can use state=DISABLED to gray out the control and make it unresponsive. If the cursor is currently over
                        the checkbutton, the state is ACTIVE.
text	                The label displayed next to the checkbutton. Use newlines ("\n") to display multiple lines of text.
underline	        With the default value of -1, none of the characters of the text label are underlined. Set this option to the index of a character in the text
                        (counting from zero) to underline that character.
variable	        The control variable that tracks the current state of the checkbutton. Normally this variable is an IntVar, and 0 means cleared and 1 means
                        set, but see the offvalue and onvalue options above.
width           	The default width of a checkbutton is determined by the size of the displayed image or text. You can set this option to a number of characters
                        and the checkbutton will always have room for that many characters.
wraplength	        Normally, lines are not wrapped. You can set this option to a number of characters and all lines will be broken into pieces no longer than that
                        number.

Medthod                                          	Description

deselect()	                   Clears (turns off) the checkbutton.
flash()	                           Flashes the checkbutton a few times between its active and normal colors, but leaves it the way it started.
invoke()	                   You can call this method to get the same actions that would occur if the user clicked on the checkbutton to change its state.
