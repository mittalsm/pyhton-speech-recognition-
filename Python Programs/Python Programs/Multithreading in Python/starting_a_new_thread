"""
Starting a New Thread:
To spawn another thread, you need to call following method available in thread module:

                        thread.start_new_thread ( function, args[, kwargs] )
                        
This method call enables a fast and efficient way to create new threads in both Linux and Windows.

The method call returns immediately and the child thread starts and calls function with the passed
list of agrs. When function returns, the thread terminates.

Here, args is a tuple of arguments; use an empty tuple to call function without passing any arguments.
kwargs is an optional dictionary of keyword arguments.
