"""
Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently, but with the following benefits:
->Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information
  or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.
->Threads sometimes called light-weight processes and they do not require much memory overhead; they care cheaper than
  processes.

A thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion. It has an instruction pointer that keeps track of
where within its context it is currently running.

->It can be pre-empted (interrupted)

->It can temporarily be put on hold (also known as sleeping) while other threads are running - this is called yielding.
